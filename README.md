## Prerequisites

1. **VPS:** Virtual private server or other computer that is publicly accessible via a web domain.
2. **Second Web Domain or Subdomain:** Required to serve the app and enable inline commands.
3. **LNbits Wallet:** Access your LNbits API key (read-only).
4. **Telegram Bot:** Create a Telegram bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain your bot token.
5. **Chat ID:** Use the [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram to find your User ID = chat ID.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoktorShift/naughtify.git
cd naughtify
```

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies in a Virtual Environment

The dependencies are installed in a virtual environment so that they are isolated from the system. Even ‚Äúpip‚Äù is not installed on every system from the outset, so here are a few preparations.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-venv
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Now we set up a virtual environment, activate it and install the dependencies in it.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Note:__ You can deactivate the editing mode of the virtual environment. It remains valid for the application. To reactivate the editing mode for the virtual environment, e.g. to update a dependency, you must first select the folder to which the virtual environment applies and then activate the virtual environment. 

```bash
# deactivate venv editing
deactivate
# activate venv editing
cd ~/naughtify
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Configure the Environment

Settings are applied and parameters are transferred here.

1. Copy the `.env` and open it.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoktorShift/naughtify/refs/heads/main/example.env
mv example.env .env
sudo nano .env
```

2. Fill in at least the first four fields of the template:

- Telegram Bot Token
- Chat ID (User ID)
- LNBIts Readonly key
- LNBits Server URL

These are heavily needed

### Step 4: Setting Up Caddy Web Server

To expose the Flask app and enable inline commands, the Telegram bot must be able to reach the server. To do this, we use a subdomain, such as naughtify.yourdomain.com. Caddy then only needs to be set up as a reverse proxy on the server.

__Important:__ Make sure that you point the DNS addresses (A and AAAA, if applicable) of your subdomain/domain to the IP address of your Virtual Private Server so that the requests are forwarded to the VPS via the domain. If you do not yet have a domain, you can obtain a free subdomain from duckdns.org.  

#### Step a: Install Caddy

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```

-> Test the web server in your internet browser with: http://yourIPaddress. Note: Does not work with every browser.

#### Step b: Configure the Caddyfile

Create and edit your Caddyfile `sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile` with the following configuration:

```plaintext
# Configuration for naughtify.yourdomain.com
naughtify.yourdomain.com {
    # Reverse proxy for webhook endpoints
    reverse_proxy /webhook* 127.0.0.1:5009

    # Reverse proxy for all other routes
    reverse_proxy * 127.0.0.1:5009

    # Enable GZIP compression
    encode gzip

    # Security headers
    header {
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
        X-Frame-Options "DENY"
        Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade"
        Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';"
    }
}
```

- Replace **`naughtify.yourdomain.com`** with your actual domain name. 
- Make sure your Flask app is running locally on `127.0.0.1:5009`.

#### Step c: Reload Caddy

Restart or reload Caddy to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

If you now call up the web domain in the browser, you should see a white page. This is fine. If not, you can find a few commands for debugging here. 

```bash
sudo systemctl status caddy
sudo journalctl -u caddy -f --since "2 hour ago"
```

You can check whether the forwarding works, for example, with this: https://dnschecker.org/ <br>
The SSL certificate e.g. with this: https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html

### Step 5: Telegram Bot Webhook Setup

To enable inline commands (like `/balance`, `/transactions`, `/info`), connect your Telegram bot to the app:

1. **Prepare Your Webhook URL:**  
   Combine your domain with the `/webhook` endpoint.  
   Example:  
   ```
   https://naughtify.example.com/webhook
   ```

2. **Set the Webhook:**  
   Replace placeholders below with your **Telegram Bot Token** and **Webhook URL**:

   - **Using a Web Browser:**  
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>
     ```
     Example:  
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABCDEF/setWebhook?url=https://naughtify.example.com/webhook
     ```

   - **Using cURL (Command Line):**  
     ```bash
     curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>"
     ```

3. **Verify the Webhook:**  
   Telegram should confirm:  
   ```json
   {
     "ok": true,
     "result": true,
     "description": "Webhook was set"
   }
   ```

---

### Step 6: Start the Application

```bash
python naughtify.py
```
Output:
```plaintext

```

### Step 7: Naughtify Autostart Service

1. Create new system service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/naughtify.service
```

2. Fill the file with the following and customize `youruser`:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Naughtify
After=network.target

[Service]
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/naughtify
EnvironmentFile=/home/youruser/naughtify/.env
ExecStart=/home/youruser/naughtify/venv/bin/python /home/youruser/naughtify/naughtify.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Activate, start and monitor:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable naughtify
sudo systemctl start naughtify
sudo systemctl status naughtify
```

From now on, naughtify will start automatically with every restart.
